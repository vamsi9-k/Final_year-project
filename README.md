# Final year project
DETECTION OF CYBER ATTACKS IN A NETWORK USING MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS 


### **Abstract**
*   The increasing time spent online has led to a rise in cyberattacks and cybercrimes.
*   Traditional protection methods are insufficient against zero-day and sophisticated attacks.
*   Machine learning techniques are being developed to detect and combat these threats.
*   The project investigates three primary machine learning techniques: Deep Belief Network, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine.

### **Introduction**
*   The rapid evolution of connected technologies (smart grids, IoT, 5G) has led to a massive increase in IP-associated devices and traffic.
*   This growth raises significant security concerns due to the exchange of sensitive data over untrusted networks.
*   Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are crucial for identifying internal and external intrusions and suspicious activities.
*   ID systems can be signature-based, anomaly-based, or hybrid. Anomaly-based IDSs, in particular, utilize statistical, information-based, and AI procedures, with recent research focusing on deep learning.
*   The document highlights the increasing sophistication of cybercrimes beyond simple login credential evaluation, emphasizing the importance of data security (availability, secrecy, genuineness).
*   Initial attack stages often involve reconnaissance, such as port scanning, which provides critical information to attackers. Machine learning algorithms like SVM are being applied to IDS models to detect such attempts.

### **Literature Survey**
*   The literature review focuses on work utilizing the NSL-KDD dataset for performance benchmarking.
*   Early work used Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) with improved backpropagation for IDS, showing reduced performance when tested with unlabeled data.
*   Later studies employed J48 decision tree classifiers and Random Tree models, demonstrating improved accuracy and lower false alert rates with reduced feature sets.
*   Two-level classification approaches, such as Discriminative Multinomial Naive Bayes (DMNB) and Ensembles of Balanced Nested Dichotomies (END) with Random Forest, have shown improved detection rates and lower false positive rates.
*   Principal Component Analysis (PCA) combined with SVM (using Radial Basis Function) achieved high detection accuracy, further improved by feature selection using information gain.
*   Other methods, including fuzzy classification with genetic algorithms and k-point algorithms, were explored for their detection accuracy and false positive rates.
*   The Optimal Path Forest (OPF) method was found to offer high identification accuracy in less time compared to SVM RBF.
